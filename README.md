`PsychoJulia` is an attempt to port [pychoacoustics](http://samcarcagno.altervista.org/pychoacoustics/pychoacoustics.html) to the Julia programming language. There is no usable version at the moment. `PsychoJulia` uses `PySide.jl` for the graphical user interface (GUI). At the moment, writing a full-blown, complex graphical user interface with `PySide.jl` is quite challenging and requires a lot of work. For this reason, development of `PsychoJulia` is stalled and it is unlikely to resume until there is an easy way to build a QT GUI with Julia.
