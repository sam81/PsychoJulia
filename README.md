[![Project Status: Abandoned â€“ Initial development has started, but there has not yet been a stable, usable release; the project has been abandoned and the author(s) do not intend on continuing development.](https://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/abandoned.svg)](https://www.repostatus.org/#abandoned)

`PsychoJulia` is an attempt to port [pychoacoustics](http://samcarcagno.altervista.org/pychoacoustics/pychoacoustics.html) to the Julia programming language. There is no usable version at the moment. `PsychoJulia` uses `PySide.jl` for the graphical user interface (GUI). At the moment, writing a full-blown, complex graphical user interface with `PySide.jl` is quite challenging and requires a lot of work. For this reason, development of `PsychoJulia` is stalled and it is unlikely to resume until there is an easy way to build a QT GUI with Julia.
